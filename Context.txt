window is the global context when we use javascript in browser. All the things are registered here.
As a result of this function can be called before and the definition can be declared at the later part.

If the window keyword in used in VSCode it will throw error as it is executed by the Node.

2 types of contexts are there: Global & Execution context.

Execution context has few major things:
1.  Variable Object
2.  Scope Chain
3.  This keyword

function declaration are scanned & made available.
variables declaration are scanned and made undefined.

when variables are used to print without assigning the value, it shows undefined. If the value is 
not assigned later on then it throws an error.

if a new context is created, it does not dig down to get the value rather it takes recent context.
